incomplete ispolin roadmap
(no particular order, I just want to do these at some point...)

- Iron out compatibility between IRCds
- IRC text color/formatting support (\003 and friends)
- Clean up that awful mess of a config loader :/
- More included modules
  - Markov text chains (maybe?)
  - Games
  - Quote database
  - Log statistics parser (complicated?)
- More handlers
- Logging
- Parse command line options
- SSL support
- Less hacky loop for ircclient_t instances
  (use select in irc_getln or something similar in order to wait for something to read, rather than failing)
- Add Lua scripting API
- General cleaning and refactoring (obviously!)
